            Hello, I'm <span>Huzaifa Sabah Uddin</span>, though you can simply call me Hexz. I'm truly passionate about coding, as it offers a unique platform for creativity, invention, and automation. For me, the world of programming is a canvas where I can craft solutions to real-world challenges and bring ideas to life. I have a particular fondness for Python and its diverse frameworks, appreciating their power and versatility. Currently, I'm a dedicated second-year student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering at the <span>University of Leicester</span>. I'm excited to be on this journey of continuous learning and innovation as I explore the ever-evolving landscape of technology and software development.
